# PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
An Interactive Quiz Application is a web-based tool designed to engage users in answering a series of questions in a dynamic and responsive environment. The objective of this task was to design and develop an application where users can select answers, receive immediate feedback, and view their final score. The development process involved multiple tools and platforms that helped in creating an efficient, visually appealing, and functional application.

# Objective
Deliver an interactive, real-time quiz experience.

Provide immediate feedback on user responses.

Display cumulative scores upon completion.

Ensure a clean, responsive, and user-friendly design.

# TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED

To complete this task, several modern web development technologies and tools were utilized:

HTML5: Used for structuring the content of the quiz. It provided the basic layout of the application including the question display area, answer options, and navigation buttons.

CSS3: Employed for styling the application. It helped enhance the user interface (UI) by adding color schemes, spacing, button designs, and animations to create an attractive and user-friendly experience.

JavaScript (Vanilla JS): The core logic of the quiz was implemented using JavaScript. It managed the functionality of loading questions, checking answers, tracking scores, and updating the UI dynamically without refreshing the page.

React.js (Optional in advanced version): In more complex versions of the quiz app, React was used to break down the application into reusable components such as QuestionCard, ScoreBoard, and Timer. It also improved state management and performance.

VS Code (Visual Studio Code): This was the primary editor platform used for coding. It offered a robust development environment with syntax highlighting, debugging tools, and extensions that made the process efficient and error-free.

Git and GitHub: Git was used for version control, allowing changes to be tracked and managed efficiently. GitHub was used for hosting the code and collaborating with other developers if needed.

# PLATFORM USED
The development of the Interactive Quiz Application was primarily done using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) on a local development server. Once tested and finalized, the application could be deployed to the web using platforms such as:

GitHub Pages ‚Äì for static hosting

Netlify ‚Äì for quick deployment and CI/CD support

Vercel ‚Äì ideal for React-based applications

# KEY FEATURES OF THIS APPLICATION
‚úÖ Multiple-choice questions with randomized options.

‚ö° Real-time feedback on answers (e.g., highlighting correct/incorrect responses).

üìä Score tracking and result display at the end of the quiz.

üîÅ Dynamic content updates without page refresh.

üì± Responsive design suitable for both desktop and mobile devices.

üß© Reusable components (in React version) for easier scalability and maintenance.
